# ðŸ”¢ Half Adder Using NAND Gates

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project presents the implementation of a **Half Adder** circuit using only **NAND gates**. A Half Adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces two outputs:
- **Sum (A âŠ• B)**
- **Carry (A Â· B)**

Instead of using the standard XOR and AND gates, this design uses only NAND gates, demonstrating how universal gates can be used to construct any logic function.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand the working of a Half Adder.
- Implement XOR and AND logic using only NAND gates.
- Simulate the logic using Verilog HDL.
- Visualize the layout and gate-level connections.

## ðŸ”§ Logic Design Using NAND Gates

### Sum (A âŠ• B)
Sum = (A NAND (A NAND B)) NAND (B NAND (A NAND B))

### Carry (A Â· B)
Carry = (A NAND B) NAND (A NAND B)

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
| - | - | --- | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 0   | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 1   | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 0   | 1     |



ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical use of universal gates in logic circuit design. Using only NAND gates simplifies manufacturing and highlights core digital logic principles.
